## Documentation Files

- **NEVER create markdown documentation files (\*.md) unless explicitly requested by the user**

  - This includes: README.md, GUIDE.md, DOCUMENTATION.md, QUICKSTART.md, etc.
  - Exception: Only create when user specifically asks for documentation
  - When updating existing documentation, always confirm it's necessary

- **Examples:**

  ```
  ❌ DON'T: Automatically create TESTING_GUIDE.md after implementing tests
  ✅ DO: Only create documentation when user says "create a guide for X"

  ❌ DON'T: Create QUICKSTART.md without being asked
  ✅ DO: Wait for explicit request like "write a quickstart guide"
  ```

## Code Over Comments

- **Prefer self-documenting code over extensive comments**
  - Use clear variable and function names
  - Keep functions focused and small
  - Only add comments for complex business logic or non-obvious decisions

## File Creation

- **Only create files that are necessary for functionality**
  - Configuration files: Yes (when needed for features)
  - Test files: Yes (when implementing tests)
  - Documentation files: Only when explicitly requested
  - Helper files: Yes (when they serve a clear purpose)

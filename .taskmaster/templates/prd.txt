- **Why it's important**: Core functionality that drives sales and helps customers make informed purchasing decisions
- **How it works**: Products are stored in PostgreSQL database with support for multiple image sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop), related products, and comprehensive metadata. Products can be marked as "new" and include detailed specifications

## 2. Shopping Cart System
- **What it does**: Allows users to add/remove products, edit quantities, and persist cart state across browser sessions
- **Why it's important**: Essential for converting browsing into purchases
- **How it works**: Currently uses localStorage for persistence, migrating to database-backed cart with 30-minute stock reservations to prevent overselling. Supports both authenticated users and guest sessions

## 3. Checkout Process
- **What it does**: Handles order creation with form validation, payment method selection (e-money or cash on delivery), and order confirmation
- **Why it's important**: Final step in the purchase funnel, must be secure and user-friendly
- **How it works**: Validates customer information, calculates totals (subtotal + $50 shipping + 20% VAT on products), creates order records, and reserves stock. Supports both logged-in users and guest checkout

## 4. Admin Panel
- **What it does**: Provides authenticated admin users with tools to manage products, view/update orders, upload media, and configure site settings
- **Why it's important**: Enables business operations and content management without technical knowledge
- **How it works**: Protected routes with role-based access control (Better Auth), CRUD operations for products, order status management, and media library management

## 5. User Authentication & Authorization
- **What it does**: Secure login/registration system with role-based access (admin vs consumer)
- **Why it's important**: Protects admin resources and enables personalized experiences for consumers
- **How it works**: Better Auth integration with PostgreSQL, supporting email/password and OAuth providers. Sessions managed securely with proper expiration

## 6. Inventory Management
- **What it does**: Tracks product stock levels and prevents overselling through reservation system
- **Why it's important**: Critical for maintaining customer trust and preventing order cancellations
- **How it works**: Stock reservations created when items added to cart (30-minute expiry), actual stock deducted on successful checkout. Automatic cleanup of expired reservations

## 7. Order Management
- **What it does**: Tracks orders through lifecycle (pending → processing → shipped → delivered) with order history for users
- **Why it's important**: Enables order fulfillment and provides transparency to customers
- **How it works**: Order records with denormalized product snapshots (for historical accuracy), status tracking, and customer information storage

## 8. Media Management
- **What it does**: Stores and serves product images in multiple sizes and types (product, category, gallery, related)
- **Why it's important**: Optimizes performance and provides appropriate images for different contexts
- **How it works**: Images stored in Vercel Blob or Cloudflare R2, URLs stored in database with metadata (size, type, order)

   - **Why second**: Frontend already expects this, minimal changes needed

3. **Stock Management Service**
   - Stock reservation logic
   - Available stock calculation
   - **Why third**: Needed before checkout can work properly

## Core Functionality Layer (Build After Foundation)

4. **Checkout API with Database**
   - Order creation in database
   - Order item creation
   - Stock deduction on checkout
   - **Why fourth**: Depends on stock management, enables order fulfillment

5. **Authentication System**
   - Better Auth setup and configuration
   - Basic login functionality
   - **Why fifth**: Needed for admin panel and user features

6. **Admin Authentication & Protection**
   - Admin login page

   - **Why sixth**: Must secure admin routes before building admin features

## Feature Layer (Build After Core)

7. **Admin Product Management**
   - Product CRUD operations
   - **Why seventh**: Admins need to manage products, depends on authentication

8. **Admin Order Management**
   - Order viewing and status updates
   - **Why eighth**: Depends on orders existing (from checkout), needs admin auth

9. **Database-Backed Cart**
   - Cart persistence for logged-in users
   - **Why ninth**: Nice-to-have enhancement, doesn't block core functionality

10. **User Order History**
   - Order viewing for consumers
   - **Why tenth**: Depends on orders existing and user authentication

## Optimization Layer (Build Last)

11. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Query optimization
   - Caching strategies

1. Start with Product API migration (frontend already built, just swap data source)
2. Then Checkout API (core purchase flow)
3. Then Admin authentication (enables content management)
4. Then Admin product management (enables business operations)

This approach ensures:
- Frontend remains functional throughout migration
- Core user flows work early
- Business operations enabled quickly
- Foundation solid for future enhancements
